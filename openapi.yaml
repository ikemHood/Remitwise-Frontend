  title: RemitWise Frontend API (v1)
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    This OpenAPI document describes the current v1 API surface for RemitWise.

    Versioning: This repo uses URL-prefix versioning (e.g. /api/v1/...). The existing
    API is considered v1. To avoid breaking existing clients, the Next.js app
    rewrites `/api/*` to `/api/v1/*`.

    Deprecation policy: When a new major version is released (for example v2),
    older major versions will be supported for a minimum of 6 months before
    removal. Security patches and critical bug fixes will be backported during
    the deprecation window. Migration guides should be provided for clients.
